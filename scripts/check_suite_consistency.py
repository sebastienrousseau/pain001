"""Check the published pain001 suite agrees with its own policy.

The suite ships one version number across every package. That is easy to
state and easy to let slip, because nothing breaks when it does: a member
left a release behind still installs, still imports, still passes its own
tests. It just quietly means something different from what it says.

Two failures this catches, both of which had already happened here:

* **A member left behind.** The pain001 packages disagreed:
  0.0.62, 0.0.64, 0.0.63, 0.0.62 and 0.0.63
  -- different numbers for one suite.

* **A version bumped in the tree and never released.** Three repositories
  in the wider suite have done this, each time stranding a `cryptography`
  advisory floor that reached nobody. Nothing fails when it happens; only
  PyPI disagrees, and only if somebody looks. This looks.

Exits non-zero when the suite disagrees with itself, so a schedule turns
into a notification rather than a report nobody opens.
